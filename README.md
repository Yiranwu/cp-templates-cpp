# CP Templates CPP

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my Competitive Programming (CP) templates, algorithms, and utilities. It is structured to facilitate efficient coding, testing, and debugging during contests.

## Directory Structure

### 📚 `/cf-lib` (Algorithm Library)
This directory contains the core algorithm and data structure implementations, organized by category:
- **`ds/`**: Advanced data structures such as Segment Trees, Binary Indexed Trees (BIT), Disjoint Set Union (DSU), Sparse Tables, etc.
- **`graph/`**: Graph algorithms including Dijkstra, Strongly Connected Components (SCC), 2-SAT, Topological Sort, etc.
- **`math/`**, **`string/`**, **`misc/`**: specialized algorithms for mathematics, string processing, and other miscellaneous utilities.

### 🐛 `/debugging` (Stress Testing & Diagnosis)
A suite of tools designed to automate the process of finding failing test cases.
- **`stress.py`**: The main orchestration script that generates random test cases, runs your solution against a "ground truth" (brute force) solution, and reports discrepancies.
- **`generate_test_case.cpp`**: C++ logic for generating random inputs.
- **`gt_sol.cpp`**: A slower but correct implementation (Ground Truth) used for verification.

### 📝 `/template` (Core Macros & Utilities)
Contains the foundational code used in almost every CP submission.
- **`cp_template.h`**: A unified header file comprising standard library includes, I/O optimization (`read_all`, `print_all`), handy macros (`rep`, `all`), bit manipulation tools, and common mathematical constants/functions.

### 🧪 `/tests` (Unit Testing)
Infrastructure to ensure the correctness of the library code.
- **`Google Test`** is used to run unit tests on data structures and algorithms in `/cf-lib`.
- Helps in maintaining reliability when modifying or optimizing library code.

### 📂 `/outputs` (Artifacts)
A scratchpad directory for generated files.
- Stores failing test cases found by `stress.py`.
- Destination for the finalized, single-file source code generated by `expand.py`.

### 📓 `/notes`
Personal notes, observations, and reminders related to competitive programming and problem-solving strategies.

## Key Files

- **`main.cpp`**: The primary workspace for writing solutions. This is the file you edit during a contest.
- **`expand.py`**: A dependency bundler script. It resolves `#include` directives from `/cf-lib` and `/template`, combining them with your `main.cpp` solution into a single, standalone source file ready for submission to online judges.

## Build and Submit "One-Click"

To compile your solution and bundle it into a single file for submission, use the custom `bundle` target. We recommend using an out-of-source build directory (e.g., `build/bundle`) to keep the root directory clean.

```bash
# Configure (one time)
cmake -S . -B build/bundle

# Build and Bundle
cmake --build build/bundle --target bundle
```

This will:
1. Compile `main.cpp` to ensure correctness.
2. Run `expand.py` to bundle dependencies.
3. Generate the submission-ready code at `outputs/output.cpp`.
